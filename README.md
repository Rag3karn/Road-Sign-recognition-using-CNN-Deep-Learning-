Road-Sign-recognition-using-CNN-Deep-Learning

Tech Stack used- Python, Neuaral Networks

GUI used- Pyqt

This is a Deep Learning project where the model trained is used to detect the road signs. Now-a-days, car accidents are taking place at a large where often car drivers do not follow the road signs present. This system can be used and modified in cars where each road sign would be said out load via the speakers of the car and hence minimizing car accidents.

I have just simply used a Convolutional Neural Network to train the model for acheiving maximum accuracy. The accuracy should always come out ot be between 93-95 percent. Also, the dataset used is so big that even if i reduce the epochs or the batch size then too the training doesn't occur, but in theory the code is correct and needs to be executed with a GPU. The training dataset almost contains 50000 iimages of varius road signs. I do hope my code is correct and the issue is related to the processing power of the pc/laptop. If anyone has any updates please push it in this repo, it would help me a lot.
